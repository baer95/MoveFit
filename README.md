Heealth Eapp for Moovemeeant eeat your Workspeace

## Idea
This app should run as a background task that reminds you of getting up and relaxing your body when your work hours solely consists of mind numbing sitting and staring at a screen.

## Technical background
GPS is used to check whether you're walking around or sit at your desk. If you don't move, a timer starts to count down from a preset time value (ie. 30 min).
Should you move, then the timer is reset. In case you don't move for a full 30 minutes, a Notification on your phone gets triggered.
Get up, have a short walk through the office or your home, and the Timer will by itself reset and start to count down towards your next break.
